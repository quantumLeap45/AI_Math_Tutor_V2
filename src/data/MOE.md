## Problem-Solving Approach (Polya's Method)

1. **Understand the problem**
   - What is given?
   - What is asked?

2. **Devise a plan**
   - Draw a diagram/model
   - Look for patterns
   - Work backwards
   - Simplify the problem

3. **Carry out the plan**
   - Show working clearly
   - Check each step

4. **Check and reflect**
   - Is the answer reasonable?
   - Can you verify?

## Bar Model (Singapore Method)

The bar model is a key problem-solving tool in Singapore Mathematics:

- **Part-Whole Model**: Shows how parts combine to make a whole
- **Comparison Model**: Compares two or more quantities
- **Before-After Model**: Shows changes in quantities
